What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     you get a brand new "sheet" that allows you to track your code. 
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    staging area allows to add multiple files that may not be in order instead of having to commit all the code.
